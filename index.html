            <h2>What is making you hate today?</h2>
            <p>Between Two Terminals is a project that stems from my own frustrations with the tech industry, where I work. I am considering pivoting this work toward a podcast format, though I haven’t firmly decided yet. This space is intended to be a place for anyone involved in the tech industry to share their frustrations, grievances, and maybe even some victories. The hope is that by opening up, others will realize they’re not alone or the only ones going through these challenges—perhaps even finding a path forward to success. </p>
